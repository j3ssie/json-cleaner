# JSON Cleaner

The utility aims to clean up output generated by popular tools by calculating a hash based on specific JSON values to removing junk data.

```bash
cat ffuf-json-output.txt | json-cleaner -f status,words,lines

cat httpx-json-output.txt | json-cleaner -f hash.body_sha256,words,lines

```
